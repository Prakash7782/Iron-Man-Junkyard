      <p><strong>Potential Dangers:</strong> Broken glass is sharp and can cause injuries. Moreover, glass disposal can cause environmental hazards if not properly handled.</p>
      <p><strong>Disposal Methods:</strong> Glass is 100% recyclable and can be reused for creating new glass products. It can be melted down to form bottles, jars, and more.</p>
      <p><strong>Procurement:</strong> Glass scrap is obtained from used containers like bottles, jars, and window glass.</p>
      <p><strong>Management:</strong> Glass should be separated from other waste to avoid contamination and ensure it can be recycled efficiently.</p>
